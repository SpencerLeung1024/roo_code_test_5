# Monopoly Game Architecture Design

## 1. Core Game Components

### Board Components
- **Game Board**: Grid representation of properties, railroads, utilities, etc.
- **Properties**: 
  - Streets (grouped by color sets)
  - Railroads (4 stations)
  - Utilities (2 utilities)
- **Special Spaces**:
  - Go
  - Jail/Just Visiting
  - Free Parking
  - Go to Jail
  - Chance (3 spaces)
  - Community Chest (3 spaces)
- **Cards**:
  - Chance deck (16 cards)
  - Community Chest deck (16 cards)

### Player Components
- Player tokens/pieces
- Player balance (numeric)
- Player properties owned
- Player position
- Player status (in jail, bankrupt, etc.)

### Game State
- Current player turn
- Dice roll state
- Auction state
- Trade state
- Game phase (setup, main game, end game)

## 2. System Architecture

### Frontend (Browser)
- Board UI
- Player UI  
- Action UI
- Modal Dialogs

### Backend (Node.js Server)
- Game Engine
- State Manager
- Event System
- API Endpoints

## 3. Data Models

### Player Model
```typescript
interface Player {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  balance: number;
  position: number;
  properties: Property[];
  inJail: boolean;
  jailTurns: number;
  bankrupt: boolean;
}
```

### Property Model  
```typescript
interface Property {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  position: number;
  price: number;
  mortgageValue: number;
  owner: string | null;
  houses: number;
  hotel: boolean;
  rent: number[];
  colorGroup: string;
}
```

### Game State Model
```typescript
interface GameState {
  players: Player[];
  currentPlayer: string;
  diceRoll: [number, number];
  phase: 'setup' | 'main' | 'end';
  properties: Property[];
  chanceCards: Card[];
  communityChestCards: Card[];
  bankBalance: number;
}
```

## 4. Key Game Mechanics

1. **Turn Sequence**:
   - Roll dice
   - Move token  
   - Land on space action
   - Buy/build/trade
   - End turn

2. **Property Actions**:
   - Purchase
   - Auction
   - Mortgage
   - Build houses/hotels
   - Pay rent

3. **Card Effects**:
   - Movement
   - Payments
   - Get out of jail free
   - Property repairs

4. **Special Rules**:
   - Jail mechanics
   - Bankruptcy
   - Trading
   - House/hotel limits

## 5. Technology Stack

### Frontend
- React (TypeScript)
- Material UI/Chakra UI  
- Zustand/Redux Toolkit
- Custom SVG board

### Backend
- Node.js + Express
- Socket.IO
- Jest testing
