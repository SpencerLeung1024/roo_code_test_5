- openrouter/horizon-alpha > horizon_alpha
FREE, 5.86M
I gave up after it kept messing up board tile sizes further and further
It chose to use React.ts and Vite
Made a working Monopoly core gameplay loop
Movement, buying property, rent

- openrouter/horizon-beta > horizon_beta
FREE, 5.3M
It decided that all subtasks were implemented and completed the orchestrating task
It chose to use React.ts and Vite
Game is unplayable (unclosable modals)
Board is messed up

- anthropic/claude-sonnet-4 > sonnet
$28.4, 29.5M
I gave up after it made no progress in moving players off GO in several turns
It chose to use Vue.js and Vite
Actually extremely thorough (wrote like 10 markdown docs at the beginning)
Never encountered an error in the log, just buggy behavior
Maybe the throughness and complexity of its plan killed it

$0.922, 1.9M
I gave up after 10 turns
It keeps forgetting to do the last items (almost as if it's in a rush?)
It chose to use no framework. Pure HTML, CSS, and JS
Undefined bugs everywhere

I had to bad DeepInfra because the fp4 quantization destroyed the model's ability to use tool calls
It decided that all subtasks were implemented and completed the orchestrating task
It chose to use no framework. Pure HTML, CSS, and JS
Hardcoded and laid out with 2 players
Unlike Horizon Alpha, this model actually fixed board styling without deteriorating
The greens and blues side is still flipped though
Made a working Monopoly core gameplay loop
Movement, buying property, rent

- moonshotai/kimi-k2 > kimi
NOTE TO SELF: EARLY STATS TO SUBTRACT:
$0.202, 1.84M
Preferred provider was set to Fireworks
I needed something with 131k context, isn't quantized weird, and isn't hammered like the official Moonshot AI API
With default routing, Roo Code will use 32k context (it checks the cheapest which is Chutes)

- z-ai/glm-4.5 > glm
$3.6, 9.1M
Clicking "Start Game" never actually started the game
It got tripped up and forgot which TODO items had been completed
It chose to use Express.js and Socket.IO
It used a server and client architecture
