# Monopoly Game - Technical Architecture Plan

## 1. Overall System Architecture

The Monopoly game will be implemented as a single-player web application using modern web technologies. The architecture will follow a client-side only approach since the game runs in a single browser and doesn't require server-side processing.

### Architecture Pattern
- **Client-Side MVC**: Model-View-Controller pattern implemented with JavaScript
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: All game logic and UI updates happen on a single HTML page
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular components for different game elements

### Technology Stack
- **HTML5**: Structure and layout
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Game logic and interactivity
- **LocalStorage**: Persistent game state saving
- **No external frameworks**: Vanilla JavaScript implementation for simplicity

## 2. Core Components and Responsibilities

### Game Engine
- Manages overall game flow and state transitions
- Coordinates between different components
- Handles turn management and game rules enforcement

### Board Manager
- Renders the game board
- Manages property positions and visual representation
- Handles player movement and position tracking

### Player Manager
- Manages player information (balance, properties, position)
- Handles player actions and decisions
- Tracks player status (active, bankrupt, etc.)

### Property Manager
- Manages all property-related data and logic
- Handles property ownership, buying, selling, and mortgaging
- Calculates rent and other property-related values

### Card Manager
- Manages Chance and Community Chest cards
- Handles card drawing and execution of card actions
- Tracks used cards and reshuffling

### UI Controller
- Handles user interactions and input
- Updates the visual representation of the game state
- Manages animations and visual feedback

### State Manager
- Maintains the current game state
- Handles saving and loading game progress
- Manages undo/redo functionality if implemented

## 3. Data Structures

### Game State
```javascript
{
  players: Player[],
  currentPlayerIndex: number,
  board: Board,
  properties: Property[],
  chanceCards: Card[],
  communityChestCards: Card[],
  gameState: 'setup' | 'playing' | 'ended',
  turnPhase: 'roll' | 'move' | 'action' | 'end',
  dice: [number, number],
  // Additional game settings and status
}
```

### Player
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  balance: number,
  position: number,
  properties: number[], // Property IDs
  inJail: boolean,
  jailTurns: number,
  getOutOfJailFreeCards: number,
  bankrupt: boolean
}
```

### Property
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  position: number,
  price: number,
  rent: number,
  colorGroup: string,
  houseCost: number,
  hotelCost: number,
  houses: number,
  hasHotel: boolean,
  owner: number | null, // Player ID or null
  mortgaged: boolean
}
```

### Card
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  type: 'chance' | 'community',
  text: string,
  action: Function // Action to execute when card is drawn
}
```

### Board
```javascript
{
  spaces: Space[],
  size: number
}
```

### Space
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  name: string,
  type: 'property' | 'railroad' | 'utility' | 'tax' | 'corner' | 'card' | 'other',
  position: number,
  // Additional properties based on space type
}
```

## 4. Game Flow and State Management

### Game Phases
1. **Setup Phase**
   - Initialize players
   - Set up board and properties
   - Shuffle cards
   - Determine starting player

2. **Turn Phase**
   - Player rolls dice
   - Player moves piece
   - Space action is executed
   - Player takes additional actions (buy, trade, etc.)
   - Turn ends

3. **End Game Phase**
   - Determine win condition
   - Display results

### State Management Approach
- Centralized game state object
- State updates through controlled methods
- UI updates triggered by state changes
- LocalStorage persistence for game continuation

## 5. User Interface Design Considerations

### Layout
- Main game board in the center
- Player information panels on the sides
- Action buttons and controls at the bottom
- Game status and messages at the top

### Visual Elements
- Color-coded property groups
- Player tokens represented by colored circles or simple icons
- Property cards with relevant information
- Dice visualization
- Monetary values displayed as numbers

### Interactions
- Click to roll dice
- Click to buy properties
- Click to manage properties (build houses, mortgage, etc.)
- Modal dialogs for card draws and important actions
- Hover effects for property information

### Responsiveness
- Adaptable layout for different screen sizes
- Scrollable areas for player information if needed
- Clear visual hierarchy for important information

## 6. File Structure and Organization

## Implementation Approach

1. Start with basic board rendering and player movement
2. Implement core game mechanics incrementally
3. Add UI elements and interactions
4. Implement data persistence
5. Polish visual design and user experience
6. Test and refine gameplay
