## Usage Instructions

### Starting a Game
```javascript
// Initialize game
const game = new MonopolyGame();
await game.init();

// Start with configuration
await game.startGame({
    players: [
        { name: 'Alice', token: '🚗', money: 1500 },
        { name: 'Bob', token: '🐕', money: 1500 }
    ],
    settings: {
        autoSave: true,
        turnTimeout: 5 * 60 * 1000 // 5 minutes
    }
});
```

### Game Flow
1. **Setup Phase**: Player configuration and game initialization
2. **Active Phase**: Turn-based gameplay
3. **Paused Phase**: Game can be paused/resumed
4. **Ended Phase**: Game over with winner announcement

### Turn Sequence
1. Current player rolls dice

3. Handle landing event (property, card, jail, etc.)
4. Player takes actions (buy, build, trade)
5. End turn and advance to next player
