## Integration Points

### GameEngine Integration
- Added `gameEndManager` to GameEngine
- Modified `checkGameOver()` to use win condition checker
- Updated `endGame()` to use GameEndManager
- Added initialization and cleanup methods

### Event System
- `game:end` - Emitted when game ends
- `win-conditions:updated` - Emitted when configuration changes
- `game:play_again` - Emitted for restart functionality
- `game:quit` - Emitted for quit functionality

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
// Initialize game with win conditions
const gameEngine = new GameEngine();
await gameEngine.init();
await gameEngine.startNewGame(gameConfig);

// Check win conditions automatically
// System monitors in real-time
```

### Configuration
```javascript
// Configure win conditions
const config = {
    [WinConditionType.NET_WORTH_TARGET]: {
        enabled: true,
        targetAmount: 10000
    },
    [WinConditionType.TIME_LIMIT]: {
        enabled: true,
        duration: 30 * 60 * 1000 // 30 minutes
    }
};

gameEngine.gameEndManager.winConditionChecker.configureWinConditions(config);
```

### Manual Game End
```javascript
// Request game end
gameEngine.gameEndManager.requestGameEnd('Manual game end');
```
