  - Monopoly validation (must own all properties in color group)
  - Even building rule enforcement
  - House/hotel cost tracking
  - Building inventory management
  - Building statistics tracking
  - Transaction handling

### 2. BuildingUI (`js/ui/BuildingUI.js`)
- **Purpose**: Complete user interface for building management
- **Features**:
  - Modal-based building interface
  - Color group organization
  - Property selection and details
  - Real-time validation feedback
  - Building cost display
  - Action buttons for build/sell operations

### 3. Building Styles (`css/components/building.css`)
- **Purpose**: Complete styling for building UI and visual indicators
- **Features**:
  - Responsive design
  - Color-coded property groups
  - Visual house/hotel indicators
  - Animation effects
  - Mobile-friendly layout

### 4. EventEmitter (`js/utils/EventEmitter.js`)
- **Purpose**: Event system for component communication
- **Features**:
  - Custom event handling
  - Multiple listener support
  - Error handling

## Key Features Implemented

### Building Rules & Validation
✅ **Monopoly Requirement**: Must own all properties in color group

### Building UI System
✅ **Property Selection**: Easy-to-use interface for selecting properties
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Real-time validation and error messages
✅ **Cost Display**: Shows building costs and current inventory
✅ **Group Status**: Displays monopoly status for each color group
✅ **Building Visualization**: Shows current buildings on each property

### Building Management
✅ **House Building**: Add houses to properties with validation
✅ **Hotel Building**: Convert 4 houses to 1 hotel
✅ **House Selling**: Sell houses back to bank at half price
✅ **Hotel Selling**: Convert hotel back to 4 houses
✅ **Inventory Tracking**: Manages bank's house/hotel supply
✅ **Statistics**: Tracks all building activities

### Visual Indicators
✅ **Board Display**: Houses and hotels shown on property squares
✅ **Color Coding**: Properties grouped by color with visual indicators
✅ **Ownership Display**: Shows property ownership with player colors
✅ **Building Counts**: Displays number of houses/hotels on each property

## Integration Steps

### 1. Include Required Files
```html
<!-- CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/components/building.css">

<!-- JavaScript -->
<script type="module" src="js/services/BuildingManager.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="js/ui/BuildingUI.js"></script>
<script type="module" src="js/utils/EventEmitter.js"></script>
```

### 2. Initialize Building System
```javascript
import { BuildingManager } from './js/services/BuildingManager.js';
import { BuildingUI } from './js/ui/BuildingUI.js';

// Create game state object
const gameState = {
    board: board,
    players: players,
    getCurrentPlayer: () => currentPlayer
};

// Initialize building system
const buildingManager = new BuildingManager(gameState);
const buildingUI = new BuildingUI(buildingManager, gameState);
buildingUI.init();
```

### 3. Add Building Button to Game UI
```javascript
// Add building button to player controls
const buildButton = document.createElement('button');
buildButton.textContent = 'Build Houses/Hotels';
buildButton.onclick = () => buildingUI.show(currentPlayer);
```

### 4. Listen for Building Events
```javascript
// Listen for building events to update UI
buildingManager.on('house:built', (data) => {
    console.log('House built:', data);
    updateBoardDisplay();
});

buildingManager.on('hotel:built', (data) => {
    console.log('Hotel built:', data);
    updateBoardDisplay();
});

buildingManager.on('house:sold', (data) => {
    console.log('House sold:', data);
    updateBoardDisplay();
});

buildingManager.on('hotel:sold', (data) => {
    console.log('Hotel sold:', data);
    updateBoardDisplay();
});
```

## Usage Examples

### Opening Building UI
```javascript
// Show building UI for current player
buildingUI.show(currentPlayer);
```

### Checking Buildable Properties
```javascript
// Get all buildable properties for a player
const buildable = buildingManager.getBuildableProperties(currentPlayer);
console.log('Buildable properties:', buildable);
```

### Manual Building Operations
```javascript
// Build a house (with validation)
const result = buildingManager.buildHouse(property, player);
if (result.success) {
    console.log('House built successfully');
} else {
    console.log('Cannot build:', result.message);
}

// Build a hotel (with validation)
const result = buildingManager.buildHotel(property, player);
if (result.success) {
    console.log('Hotel built successfully');
} else {
    console.log('Cannot build:', result.message);
}
```

### Getting Building Statistics
```javascript
// Get building statistics
const stats = buildingManager.getBuildingStats();
console.log('Building stats:', stats);

// Get building inventory
const inventory = buildingManager.getBuildingInventory();
console.log('Available houses:', inventory.houses);
console.log('Available hotels:', inventory.hotels);
```

## Testing the System

### Demo Page
A complete demo is available at `demo-building.html` which includes:
- Pre-configured players with properties
- Building UI integration
- Real-time updates
- Building statistics
- Visual feedback

### Test Scenarios
1. **Monopoly Building**: Test building on complete color groups
2. **Even Building Rule**: Verify houses are built evenly
3. **Hotel Conversion**: Test 4 houses → 1 hotel conversion
4. **Inventory Limits**: Test building when supplies are low
5. **Mortgage Restrictions**: Test building on mortgaged properties
6. **Fund Validation**: Test building with insufficient funds
