const result = gameEngine.propertyService.mortgageProperty(player, property);
```

const trade = {
    fromPlayer: player1,
    toPlayer: player2,
    properties: [property1, property2],
    money: 200
};
const result = gameEngine.propertyService.tradeProperties(trade);
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the complete test suite:
```javascript
import { PropertyTransactionTest } from './js/test-property-transactions.js';
const test = new PropertyTransactionTest();
await test.runTests();
```

### Manual Testing
Use the demo interface:
1. Open `demo-property-transactions.html`
2. Click "Setup Demo Game"
3. Use test controls to try different features

## Configuration

### Constants
Key constants are defined in `js/config/constants.js`:
- Mortgage rate: 50% of property value
- Unmortgage rate: 110% of mortgage value
- Starting money: $1500

### Customization
- Property prices and rents can be modified in constants
