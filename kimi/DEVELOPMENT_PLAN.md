## Code Quality Standards

### Naming Conventions
- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `GameEngine`)
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., `calculateRent`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_PLAYERS`)
- Files: kebab-case (e.g., `game-engine.js`)

### Code Structure
- Maximum 200 lines per file
- Clear separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

### Documentation
- JSDoc for all public methods
- Inline comments for complex logic
- README for each major component
- Architecture decision records

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test each class in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Test edge cases
- Achieve 80% code coverage

### Integration Tests
- Test game flow scenarios
- Test player interactions
- Test save/load functionality
- Test error handling

### Manual Testing
- Play complete games
- Test all edge cases
- Verify calculations
- Check UI responsiveness

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test early and often
- **Performance**: Profile and optimize
- **State Management**: Implement robust save/load
- **Complexity**: Keep components small and focused

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features
- **Time Management**: Use time-boxing
- **Code Quality**: Regular refactoring
- **Testing**: Write tests alongside features
